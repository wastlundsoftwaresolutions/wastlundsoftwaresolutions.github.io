            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Starfish Trivia application (the "App"). At Wastlund Software Solutions ("we," "us," or "our"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information.</p>

            <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

            <h2>Information Stored Locally</h2>
            <p>The App stores some data locally on your device to enhance your user experience. This data includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Scores:</strong> To track your best performance in each trivia category.</li>
                <li><strong>Seen Questions:</strong> To ensure you receive new questions in subsequent quizzes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information is stored exclusively on your device using standard application storage and is never transmitted to us or any third party. You have full control over this data, and it can be cleared by deleting the App from your device.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
